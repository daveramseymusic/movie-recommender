# movie-recommender 
This is a movie recommender based off the Fast.AI Collaborative Filtering model.  It uses machine learning to find 30 movies that are most similar to the movie typed by the user in the text box.  The app is hosted on gradio, but this can also be used on the daverameymusic/github.io page.
